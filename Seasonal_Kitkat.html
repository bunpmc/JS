                Sweet Potato Flavor
            </h3>

            <p> 
                It’s a huge deal in the fall, making it extremely fitting for it to come in a Kit Kat flavor.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                Sakura Mochi
            </h3>
            <img src="Reference/Mochi.webp" title="Sakura Mochi" alt="Sakura Mochi">
            <p>
                This flavor only comes around during the spring. Delicately flavored pink white chocolate is gently floral, 
                an earthy sweetness comes from the azuki bean powder blended in.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Pistachio
            </h3>    
            <img src="Reference/Pistachio.webp" title="Pistachio" alt="Pistachio">
            <p>
                This flavor seemed to have only been around during the spring months for a couple of years. 
                The pistachio flavor comes from the cream in between the wafers.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                Shio Lemon
            </h3>    
            <img src="Reference/Shio.webp" title="Shio Lemon" alt="Shio Lemon">
            <p>
                The flavor or shio (salt) lemon might sound a bit questionable to some. These were only around in July 2023.
